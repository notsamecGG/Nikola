# Nikola
Hello, welcome! 
This is a school project. It's a simulation of fluids using Lngragian-SPH method.
The step (fluid) shader is based on [Mueller et. 2003](https://people.computing.clemson.edu/~dhouse/courses/881/papers/mueller03.pdf).


Rendering is handled with custom abstraction (backend) on top of WGPU-rs library, with custom rayctracing (render-shader) shaders.

UI is handled with imgui crate.
